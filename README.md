### Jupyter notebook with the analysis of the results of conducted experiments

Datasets for the comparison of algorithm implementations:
- results_myImpl_protocol_2.csv: contains results of soundness verification using the own implementation of Algorithm 1.
- results_qeIml_protocol_2.csv: contains results of soundness verification using the QE-based implementation of Algorithm 1.

Dataset for evaluation of influence of DPN characteristics on the complexity of the soundness verification algorithm:
- results_qeIml_total.csv: contains results of soundness verification using the QE-based implementation of Algorithm 1.
